Plain English: Sort last names in ascending order

From a list of last names, sort by value from smallest (A) to largest (Z).
If more than one item begins with A, sort items beginning with A by the value of each item's second letter from smallest (A) to largest (Z).

Continue sorting items beginning with A until no further items begin with A. 

Move on to B, applying the same logic. 

Continue through the rest of the alphabet, until all names are sorted.
